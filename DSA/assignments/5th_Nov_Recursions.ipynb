    "An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.\n",
    "The recursive approach to check for Armstrong numbers has two main parts:\n",
    "1. Count the number of digits in the number (n)\n",
    "2. Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of n\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case:\n",
    "- If we've processed all digits (index == length of num_str), return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Case:\n",
    "- Take the current digit, raise it to the power of n, and add it to the sum of\n",
    "  powers for the remaining digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(d) where d is the number of digits in the input number.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(d) due to the recursion call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This problem demonstrates how recursion can be used to process individual digits of a number. The recursive function elegantly breaks down the task of calculating the sum of powers by handling one digit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\n",
    "- 134 is not an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 27 + 64 = 92 ≠ 134\n",
